# scratch.mit.edu-projects
A repository for all the Scratch projects I have worked on!

There are two projects in this repository that I have worked on; <br>
A game called "The Space Game" [Game Development] <br>
And a Graphic where I animated my name [Animation/Graphics]<br><br><br>
1. The following image contains the Code Blocks of "The Space Game" i created: <br><br>

There are three blocks of code written to construct this simple game;<br>
<li> The first block initialises movement length and the direction angle of the ball </li></br>
<li> The next block initialises the score to zero </li><br>
<li> The final block increments the score by 5 everytime the ball touches the paddle </li><br><br><br>
2. The following image contains the Code Blocks of an animated version of my name: <br><br>

We can animate the letters using two blocks;<br><br>
<li> The first block contains details about the rotation movement and other actions performed by the letters </li><br>
<li> The other block contains the transition from changes that occured due to execution of first block </li></br><br>
That's it for now, Will post some new projects after i finally complete them :)
